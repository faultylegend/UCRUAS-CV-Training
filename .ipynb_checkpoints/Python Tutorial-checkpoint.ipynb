    "Unlike C++, which is a compiled language, Python is an interpreted language. This means that, instead of compiling the entire code before running, the code is \"interpreted\" as it runs. There are a few key differences in the two:\n",
    "1. With a compiled language, the programmer has more control over the CPU than in an interpreted language. <br/><br/>\n",
    "2. While no longer as impactful as years before, with a compiled language, a programmer would put all the compile time before running the program, allowing for the program itself to run more quickly. On the other hand, an interpreted language would be interpreting a program's code *while* the program is running, leading to some inefficiencies. As time goes on, this time gap becomes smaller and smaller, but it is important to know the differences nonetheless."
